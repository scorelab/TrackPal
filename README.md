## About

In Sri Lanka, the transportation tracking problem is a huge challenge. The passengers can't determine the current position of their transportation medium (in this case it may be bus or train) correctly. So they have to wait until it arrives at their pickup location (it may be a bus stop, bus stand or railway station). So TrackPal is the solution to this problem.

TrackPal is a public based mobile application that will be implemented using react-native. And the components that are in operation with this application, will be created based on the Go-social components. By using this mobile application, users can share their locations when they are on a bus or train and that shared location will be updated when it moves and other users can see the shared details. This will solve the problem with users have, so that they can find the bus's or train's current location by just tapping on a route or train number on the screen.
